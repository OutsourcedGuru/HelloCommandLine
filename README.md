## HelloGo
Written using Visual Studio Code in the Go programming language, this is the minimal code you might find in a command line program and how to compile it.

### Running the program
```
$ cd ~/oca/HelloCommandLine/HelloGo/dist/
$ ./HelloGo
Hello, Go
```

1. Edit the `main.go` program file, as necessary
2. In the Terminal window of VS Code, enter `go run main` to execute it
3. Again in the Terminal window of VS Code, enter `go build` under the project folder to build it into an executable program
5. Copy the `HelloGo` program file to somewhere in your path for the sake of convenience when you're finished

## HelloC
Written using XCode in the C programming language, this is the minimal code you might find in a command line program and how to compile it.
